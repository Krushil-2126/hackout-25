This project is a Green Hydrogen Infrastructure Mapping and Optimization Web Application designed to help visualize, analyze, and optimize the deployment of green hydrogen plants, factories, and investment opportunities. The goal of this platform is to provide an interactive map-based system where stakeholdersâ€”such as policymakers, investors, researchers, and energy companiesâ€”can assess the viability of hydrogen-based projects across different regions in india.

At its core, the application provides a dashboard and data visualization tools to track renewable energy resources, hydrogen demand zones, and potential factory or plant locations. It includes optimizers and analytics features that simulate production, transportation, and investment scenarios, helping users make data-driven decisions.

In addition to technical simulations, the platform encourages collaboration between industries, researchers, and governments through a shared environment where strategies and projects can be compared. With features like factory visualization, investment mapping, collaboration modules, and plant optimizers, the project offers a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainable hydrogen infrastructure planning.

The application is built using React.js with HashRouter for smooth GitHub Pages deployment, ensuring that navigation between pages (Home, Login, Signup, Dashboard, Map, Analytics, etc.) works correctly even on static hosting platforms. It is designed to be scalable, visually interactive, and beginner-friendly, making it a suitable demonstration project for hackathons, sustainability initiatives, and energy transition research.
